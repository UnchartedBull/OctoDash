# Focus theme v0.1

This theme is based on the classy [NOX theme](../../NOX/) by NoxHirsch and has been modified to Focus on highlighting the most important information for a user. The goal was to create a theme that could easily be read from a distance. Some of the features are listed below:
* High contrast display of relevant information (e.g. print time, temperature)
* Low contrast display of all other info (e.g. units, time elapsed)
* Large horizontal and vertical progress bars readable from a distance.
* Large print time remaining indicators
* Pre-printing screen highlighting buttons.
* Full screen menus and adjustments with coloured backgrounds for context.
* Red highlighting of error messages

To install copy the custom-styles.css file into the octodash config folder:
```
~/.config/octodash/custom-styles.css
```
