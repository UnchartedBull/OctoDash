# Glanceable theme v0.2

This variation on the standard theme includes a nearly full width horizontal progress bar during printing. This makes it far easier to see the progress of a print when glancing at the screen from a distance, hence the name "Glanceable theme".

To install copy the custom-styles.css file into the octodash config folder:

```
~/.config/octodash/custom-styles.css
```
