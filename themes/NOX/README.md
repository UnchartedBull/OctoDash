# NOX theme V0.2.2

I suggest setting the thumbnail resolution in PrusaSlicer a little bit higher if you want a sharper image:

```
thumbnails = 16x16,330x186
```

You also need to activate this setting in OctoDash:

**Settings > OctoDash > Preview by default while printing**

If you want to use the round progress bar:

**Settings > OctoDash > Always use circular progress bar**
